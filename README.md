# Basic Java Chat

This is a simple proof of concept java chat program using threads and scoket. To run you will need to compile Server.java and Client.java. Run the server first and then as many clients as needed. You can private message with the /w <usernamehere> <messagegoeshere> or select them the user list. I will be adding more features to this as I get time.
